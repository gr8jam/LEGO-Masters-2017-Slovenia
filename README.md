# Welcome to the LEGO-Masters-2017-Slovenia wiki!  
  
## About competition  
LEGO Masters 2017 is a annual student competition for autonomous mobile robots in Slovenia. Different task is issued each year by the LEGO Masters organisers and is given to student teams approximately 5 mouths before the competition. The task in 2017 was to build fully autonomous racing robot. Robot had be able to drive around the racetrack in clockwise direction, avoid and navigate around obstacles, and overpass the opponent's vehicle. The racetrack dimensions and floor patterns were known in advance while obstacle positions were selected randomly before the start of each race. The racetrack can be seen in picture below.

Robot had to be build from Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit that was supplied to each team by the LEGO Masters organisers. No other parts could be used. The software on the other hand could be developed in any of supported programming languages. 
  
## About project
This project is the result of one of the participating teams. The author of this project are Matej Jegliè and Peter Krapež. The plan was to develop advance algorithms for autonomous racing robot in Matlab and later translate code in programming language RobotC which is supported by Lego Mindstorms EV3 controller unit.  
This [repository](https://github.com/matejjeglic/LEGO-Masters-2017-Slovenia.git) contains only Matlab part. The authors build 2D environment with racetrack, obstacles and a racing robot. Different algorithms can be tested and developed using this race simulation.
